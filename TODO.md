- [x] command line options for quantization filter
  - by maximum file size
  - by quantization method
- [x] rename it to ```llamacpp-download``` ? YES
  - seems definitly a better name

  - it has nothing to do with huggingface_playground
- [x] add quantisation option
- [x] handle the model selection with it
- [x] create a npm for it
