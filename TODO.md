- [ ] rename it to ```llamacpp-download``` ? YES
  - seems definitly a better name
- [ ] put all that in its own repo
  - it has nothing to do with huggingface_playground
- [ ] improve the search capability
  - ```llamacpp-download list```
  - ```llamacpp-download search listOfTerms```
  - ```llamacpp-download download modelName```
  - if no command is present, assume it is ```download```
  - support ```-v``` verbose option to display more info on the models: likes, download
- [ ] command line options for quantization filter
  - by maximum file size
  - by quantization method
- [ ] how to guess/discover the maximum GPU memory available ?
  - discover by querying the OS
  - discover by testing model one by one
